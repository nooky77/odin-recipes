		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
			made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound
				of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until
				translucent with the ground meat.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato
				sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two
				tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage
				cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Noodles</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna
				noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use
				the oven-ready variety to save time.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned
				and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's
				translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the
				parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and
				sugar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted
				water until they're al dente.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese,
				eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a
				bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the
				recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until
				the lasagna is assembled.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven
				for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking
				until the top is golden brown.
			</li>
			<li>Enjoy.</li>
